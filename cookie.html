  it’s a favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe that’s been top-rated by hundreds of satisfied home cooks.

  Ingredients

  2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
  1 teaspoon baking soda
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  1 cup butter, softened
  3/4 cup granulated sugar
  3/4 cup packed brown sugar
  1 egg
  1 teaspoon vanilla
  2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
  1 cup coarsely chopped nuts, if desired

  Steps:
  1 Heat oven to 375°F. In small bowl, mix flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.

  2 In large bowl, beat softened butter and sugars with electric mixer on medium speed,
    or mix with spoon about 1 minute or until fluffy, scraping side of bowl occasionally.

  3 Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour mixture just until blended (dough will be stiff).
    Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.

  4 Onto ungreased cookie sheets, drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.

  5 Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). Cool 2 minutes;
    remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Store covered in airtight container.

  Tip: Line flat cookie sheets with parchment for easy cleanup. Be sure to give the dropped dough plenty of air space,
  so the cookies won’t bump into each other as they spread.
